Problem Understanding
Insurance costs vary from person to person. We want to have a better understand of what factors impact insurance costs.

Goals
1. To work locally with an imported dataset, analyze it using functions, and use libraries to assist analysis.
2. To analyze US medical insurance costs in the context of various factors (age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoker status, region, and charges).
3. To determine how each factor affects insurance costs.
4. To understand what types of people use insurance.
5. To attempt to predict medical insurance costs based on provided factors - insurance forecast by using linear regression.
